# Research-Methods-and-Professional-Practice-2025
In this module, I have completed 2 assignments including the Literature Review in Unit 7 and the Research Proposal Presentation in Unit 10. In the following sections, I will be providing a evaluation of these 2 assignments as well as giving reflection on areas including statiscal analysis practices, research method deployed in the learning process and research project and how this module has impacted my own academic and professional experience.

## **1.	Literature Review**
For the Literature Review, I used a simple and logical progression, simply dividing the entire article into 5 sections below
- Focus, Aim, and Academic Investigation Principles
- Need and Significance of the Review
- Literature Search Strategy and Methodological Evaluation
- Findings
- Conclusion
  
[Strengthen]

Firstly, I stated clearly my "Focus" and "Aim" in the first paragraph so that I can set the scene and tune of the article and let the readers understand my topic of the Literature review. And then, I also stated the importance of my chosen topic because it highlights the relevant and significance to the financial integrity and impacts to Hong Kong specifically.

After that, it is also helpful to state the evaluation methodology used in this literature, this not only allows the readers understand what data was collected and how they were collected, but also allow readers to have their own thoughts and analysis if the selected methodology was appropriate and if the data is relevant of sufficient to answer the research question effectively.

In the “Findings” section, it clearly stated the financial impacts on a quantitative perspective such as “financial loses reached over $260,000 HKD per average” and “Ransomware cases increased to 354% comparing to last year”. 

Last but not least, the selection of real-world case study from Norsk Hydro also demonstrates successful incident response and mitigation strategies are deployed in real life, adding the practical relevance on the topic. 

[Weakness]

However, there are shortcomings in this Literature Review. 

The first thing is this Literature focus primarily on Quantitative research method, whereas this topic will also benefit from Qualitative research method because subject matters including actual experiences from cyber security professional, mitigation, recovery and gaps in existing cyber security practices can also broaden the views on the article, give the readers more perspective to understand the financial impacts by Ransomware. 

Secondly, this article did not mention the search teams, inclusion or exclusion criteria, this will let readers to have doubts in whether the research method and scope are sufficient enough to cover all the academic information or data to answer the research question effectively.

Last but not least, regarding the actual cyber attack case from Norsk Hydro, the article provided a brief discussion on the countermeasures taken by the organization, without detailing or analyzing how those measures effectively resolve the issue and how those measures can be applied in Hong Kong to prevent possible attacks in the future.
