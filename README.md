# Research-Methods-and-Professional-Practice-2025
In this module, I have completed 2 assignments including the Literature Review in Unit 7 and the Research Proposal Presentation in Unit 10. In the following sections, I will be providing a evaluation of these 2 assignments as well as giving reflection on areas including statiscal analysis practices, research method deployed in the learning process and research project and how this module has impacted my own academic and professional experience.

## **1.	Literature Review**
For the Literature Review, I used a simple and logical progression, simply dividing the entire article into 5 sections below
- Focus, Aim, and Academic Investigation Principles
- Need and Significance of the Review
- Literature Search Strategy and Methodological Evaluation
- Findings
- Conclusion
  
[Strengthen]

Firstly, I stated clearly my "Focus" and "Aim" in the first paragraph so that I can set the scene and tune of the article and let the readers understand my topic of the Literature review. And then, I also stated the importance of my chosen topic because it highlights the relevant and significance to the financial integrity and impacts to Hong Kong specifically.

After that, it is also helpful to state the evaluation methodology used in this literature, this not only allows the readers understand what data was collected and how they were collected, but also allow readers to have their own thoughts and analysis if the selected methodology was appropriate and if the data is relevant of sufficient to answer the research question effectively.

In the “Findings” section, it clearly stated the financial impacts on a quantitative perspective such as “financial loses reached over $260,000 HKD per average” and “Ransomware cases increased to 354% comparing to last year”. 

Last but not least, the selection of real-world case study from Norsk Hydro also demonstrates successful incident response and mitigation strategies are deployed in real life, adding the practical relevance on the topic. 

[Weakness]

However, there are shortcomings in this Literature Review. 

The first thing is this Literature focus primarily on Quantitative research method, whereas this topic will also benefit from Qualitative research method because subject matters including actual experiences from cyber security professional, mitigation, recovery and gaps in existing cyber security practices can also broaden the views on the article, give the readers more perspective to understand the financial impacts by Ransomware. 

Secondly, this article did not mention the search teams, inclusion or exclusion criteria, this will let readers to have doubts in whether the research method and scope are sufficient enough to cover all the academic information or data to answer the research question effectively.

Last but not least, regarding the actual cyber attack case from Norsk Hydro, the article provided a brief discussion on the countermeasures taken by the organization, without detailing or analyzing how those measures effectively resolve the issue and how those measures can be applied in Hong Kong to prevent possible attacks in the future.


## **2.	Research Proposal Presentation**

[Strengthen]

The presentation is generally well structured and the same logical progression from the Literature Review was also presented clearly in the presentation, with the additional section of Key Literature and Methodology and Research Design and more, in order to guide the audience how the research is planned and executed accordingly. 

The important statistics analysis from Section 2: Significance to the Research Problem and Section 4: Key Literature, effectively grabs the audience’s attention and also allow the audience get a comprehensive understanding and the urgency of the ransomware threats.

In Section 5: Methodology and Research Design, this section managed to describe how each research method (qualitative and quantitative) was going to deploy and what kind of data is going to collect. For example, Qualitative research method collects textual data such as cyber security effectiveness and gaps in existing cyber security practices and policies; whereas quantitative research method collects statistical data including ransom payments, legal fees, operational disruptions, system recovery from historical data. 

This part is very crucial to the presentation of the research project because it allows the audience to review the applicability of each research method through the tangible interviews, surveys as well as the data analysis processes that are going to take place.

[Weakness]

However, there are also shortcomings in the research proposal presentation.

Firstly, in section 4, it presented some crucial statistics data and findings from a single source only, which is a statistical report published in 2022 by Hong Kong Legislative Council. The quality of the research will benefit a lot by including a more diverse types of references such as from academic journals and case studies, this can undoubtedly strengthen the theoretical foundations as well as identify more research gaps in the industry. 

Furthermore, in section 5, it did not mention key aspects of the research such as sample size, sampling strategy, participants selections criteria, survey question design and interview protocols. These items are also crucial elements from the research perspective as it will impact the validity and reliability of the qualitative and quantitative findings of the research. 

In addition, regarding the Financial Analysis from the Quantitative research section, it did not mention the analytical techniques that will be deployed, such as regression analysis, correlation coefficients or even the datasets that will be using. Items like these would enhance reproducibility for future research and analysis.

## **3.	Reflection**

Academically, the research project enhances my knowledge in planning and executing research in a more sophisticated and professional manner. It opens a door for me to explore further on research method, research design as well as how to apply them in the future. 

Professionally, as a data analyst in Hong Kong, it also motivates me to enhance my technical knowledge on data related subject such as data collection, data cleaning as well as choosing the right data analysis methodology in research.

## **4.	Conclusion**
