In this module, I have completed 2 assignments including the Literature Review in Unit 7 and the Research Proposal Presentation in Unit 10. In the following sections, I will be providing a evaluation of these 2 assignments as well as giving reflection on areas including statiscal analysis practices, research method deployed in the learning process and research project and how this module has impacted my own academic and professional experience.

## **1.	Literature Review**
For the Literature Review, I used a simple and logical progression, simply dividing the entire article into 5 sections below
•	Focus, Aim, and Academic Investigation Principles
•	Need and Significance of the Review
•	Literature Search Strategy and Methodological Evaluation
•	Findings
•	Conclusion 

Firstly, I stated clearly my "Focus" and "Aim" in the first paragraph so that I can set the scene and tune of the article and let the readers understand my topic of the Literature review. And then, I also stated the importance of my chosen topic because it highlights the relevant and significance to the financial integrity and impacts to Hong Kong specifically.
After that, it is also helpful to state the evaluation methodology used in this literature, this not only allows the readers understand what data was collected and how they were collected, but also allow readers to have their own thoughts and analysis if the selected methodology was appropriate and if the data is relevant of sufficient to answer the research question effectively.
In the “Findings” section, it clearly stated the financial impacts on a quantitative perspective such as “financial loses reached over $260,000 HKD per average” and “Ransomware cases increased to 354% comparing to last year”. 
Last but not least, the selection of real-world case study from Norsk Hydro also demonstrates successful incident response and mitigation strategies are deployed in real life, adding the practical relevance on the topic.
